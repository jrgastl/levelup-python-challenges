Author Note:
So, this was a big challenge for me. I've got stuck on it for a while.
I understand that the most "pythonic" solution for it is the backtracking. Additionally, the solution from the instructor implements the itertools module as well.
In the end, I left in the first part of the code my attempts to use a logic to solve the problem. If the puzzle is not solved with the logic, then backtracking is applied.

Briefing:
Create a function to solve a sudoku puzzle.

    Until this point in the code, the puzzle can be solved, but puzzle master and extreme cannot. This is where I got stuck most of the time trying to figure out how to solve it. Finally, 
    I decided to rely in the backtracking solution, which, to the point where I am writing this code, is still a bit difficult to completely understand. I checked how to do it a few
    times, but I will try to redo now alone.
